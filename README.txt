### Requierments:
Python 3
scikit-learn
numpy
yellobricks
seaborn
matplotlib
pandas
jupyter

### Run the code:
There are two notebooks, p1_breast_cancer and p1_adult. Each explores its own dataset.
p1_breast_cancer.ipynb has the code that explores the UCI Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset
p1_adult.ipynb has the code that explores the UCI Adult dataset

To run the code, start a jupyter notebook and select the desired notebook. 
Once you have selected the notebook, you can run each individual cell or run the whole notebook. 
Warning, the `p1_adult.ipynb` contains many more intances, so the training takes a long time.
